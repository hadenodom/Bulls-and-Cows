**Bulls and Cows** 

Also known as Mastermind, this is a game in which one attempts to guess a 4-digit code.  With every guess, one is told by the game/dealer/etc how many digits they guessed correctly and in the right place, and how many digits they guessed correctly, but got in the wrong place.  

Example:  Let's assume the correct code is 1234.  If you guess 1256, you will get the following response:

> Number of digits in the right place: 2
> Number of digits guessed correctly but in the wrong place: 0

This game is built in Python2, and is not yet compatible with Python3.  I apologize for nothing and will likely not maintain this game in the future.  You should try building it in your favorite language, or a language you don't yet know - great way to learn. 

**TODO**:

* If bored, port to Python3
* Reduce codebase and/or make codegolf version
* Package for distros? 
* Ncurses?

If anyone wants to fork this and play around with it, I welcome them.
